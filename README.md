# Anselm_2015-2017

* I worked as an Oracle Agile Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) Consultant in Anselm from 2015 to 2017, and I specialized in most of the Agile PLM modules such as Product Collaboration (PC) module, Product Portfolio Management (PPM) module, Enterprise Visualization (EV) module, Product Quality Management (PQM) module, and Product Governance & Compliance (PG&C) module.

* I also had experience in conducting service in other Information Systems such as Global Specification Management (GSM) module of Oracle PLM for Process System, and Innovation Management (IM) module of Oracle Application Cloud System.

* During the time worked as an Oracle Agile PLM consultant, I had contributed my knowledge and expertise in helping over 7 world-class companies across different fields such as high-tech industry, manufacturing industry, pharmaceutical industry, and food industry.

* I have learned lots of things from this working experience such as analytical skills, customer consultancy, cross-department teamwork, and communication skills toward different clients.

* As an independent consultant of Anselm, I was also in charge of mentoring several summer interns for a few months, and this experience also supplied me with a chance in learning how to be a good supervisor.

* I self-considered played a good role working as a PLM Consultant in Anselm that I was asked to reconsider my resignation and stay in Anselm by the department manager, even I had decided to leave the company.
